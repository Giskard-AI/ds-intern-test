# Technical exercises - Machine Learning internships @ Giskard

Hi! As part of our recruitment process, we’d like you to complete the following technical test in 10 days. Once you finish the exercise, you can send your notebook or share your code repository by email (matteo@giskard.ai). If you want to share a private GitHub repository, make sure you give read access to [`mattbit`](https://github.com/mattbit).

If you have problems running the notebook, get in touch with Matteo at matteo@giskard.ai.

We hope this assignment will also offer a chance to learn something new. Good luck!

## Overview

We have two available ML internship tracks:
1. ML Research internship
2. ML Advocate Engineer internship

Based on the track you decided to follow, you will need to complete a different assignment. 

## ML Research internship

The assignment for ML Research intern is presented in this notebook: [DS_R&D_Assignment.ipynb](DS_R&D_Assignment.ipynb). The assignment consists in 5 exercises, in increasing order of difficulty. The first three exercises should be relatively simple, you shouldn’t spend too much time on them.

All the files needed in the exercises are included in this repository (e.g. `points_1.npy`, `stopwords.txt`).

Keep in mind that we strongly value:
- code quality, clarity & neatness
- short and straight to the point explanations if needed
- reasoned processes more than brute-force solutions
- reasoning more than the outcome


## ML Advocate Engineer internship

You will find the assignment for ML Advocate Engineer intern in this notebook: [DS_TechWriting_Assignment.ipynb](DS_TechWriting_Assignment.ipynb). The assignment consists in 2 exercises, the first one is a technical exercise and second a writing one. 

All the files needed in the exercises are included in this repository (e.g. `stopwords.txt`).

Keep in mind that we strongly value:
- code quality, clarity & neatness
- short and straight to the point explanations if needed
- reasoned processes more than brute-force solutions
- reasoning more than the outcome
